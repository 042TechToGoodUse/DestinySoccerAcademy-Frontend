          <p class="px-5 text-white">We are specifically focused on raising young football talents within the following age categories;</p>
          <ul class="py-2 px-5 text-white">
            <li class="py-2 px-2">Under-10</li>

          <p class="container text-white">
            We recognize the efforts, time, commitment needed to groom children to the level where they can become top talents.  We recruit into the Academy from the age of 8 years to 16 years. Most of the recruits in these categories are all children of primary and secondary school age.<br>
            We also operate with a view to raising stars from the streets to reduce crime and other social vices by young people. The Academy is also fully responsible for indigent children who cannot afford to pay for the services at the Academy but are very talented. We try as much as possible to work
            with the teachers and parents of our children to ensure that there is a fair balance between the children’s academics and football.<br>
            Lastly and importantly is our off-football trainings, designed to strengthen our children’s life-saving skills. Understanding that as the children grow so they will need skills to navigate life especially in dealing with issues of drugs, HIV, sexual reproductive health etc. <br> We have also 
            introduced community service, which is a compulsory task for all the Academy students. We want to instil discipline and the need to give back to community.<br>
            We have built good partnership with some organisations in the United States that are committed to supporting the development of grassroots football through the provision of sport equipment for the development of young talents in Enugu. In addition, we have active link to scholarship opportunities
            in the United States for better education and opportunity for the young talents to blossom into great footballers.<br>
            Our board of trustees are made up of renowned professional football administrators, Religious leaders, media CEO and football coaches whose wealth of experience guides the academy to provide standard and quality training for all who are in the academy. The academy though young, but has the vision
            to transform how young talents are groomed.

          Through dedicated and committed partners, DSA came up with an innovative idea called <b>‘Fix a pitch’. Fix a pitch</b> is a program designed to renovate,
          furbish and grass school football pitches. This is a public-Private partnership program meant to help improve the game of football across schools. In
          line with this, DSA seek to commence this program with <b class="text-bold">GOVERNMENT SECONDARY SCHOOL (GSS) (Opposite Shoprite mall)</b> in Enugu.
